# DataProfiling

 ## Synopsis

 Here are some Data Profiling scripts that aim to profile raw data, comput statistics in order to get insights of the selected Data.
 Based on one or a set of xls documents, in `Input/` directory, that contains catches of a table, which correspond to an activity history.  The main script generate an excel file with statistics in a record for each xls file, and with a label : Regular or Unregular.


 ## Motivation

 This project is part of the *M2 Miage ID* training at [Paris-Dauphine][] University, in particular for my final Thesis : How to make reliable the impacts on applications in interaction, following an evolution of a solution ?  https://mrihani.vvv.enseirb-matmeca.fr/donnee/memoireRIHANI.pdf      


 ## Deploy

 Make sure that you have **Python** (2.7) installed on your system. If not, please download it beforehand.  

 Clone DataProfiling with `git clone https://github.com/SimoRihani/DataProfiling.git`
 Save some files of Regular or Unregular label in `ÃŒnput/`directory (examples of input files are in the `Data/Regular/` and `Data/Unregular/` directories).

 Then run the following :

    cd DataProfiling/
    chmod +x *.sh

    ./script.sh

 And follow instructions.
